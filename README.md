# landing-page-project
Landing page project as part of the Oding Project

This is the second project from The Foundations course as part of The Odin Project.

We have to create a landing page by following a template that was provided but can make it about any subject so I decided to create a fishing magazine called Lurebox. I made the logo as an svg file, got a few non-copyrighted stock fishing photos and got to work.

Enjoy the result, I personally think it turned out looking pretty good!
